## What's the book about?
The book is an overview of several topics of cloud security for professionals.

## What specifically does the book cover?
Chapter 1 - Understanding the evolution of the cloud and its impact on security
Begins by defining different cloud types that is ostly copied directly from NIST 800-145, private cloud, public, hybrid, and community. It also covers PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS. The chapter proposes a couple of decent models, one looking at the primary challenges for cloud based on your organisations cloud maturity level, an another evaluating who does what in the shared responsibility model of cloud computing. 

Chapter 2 - Getting started with cloud security in our organisation
Starts by defining responsibilities within the org. Looks at assessing risk using frameworks like the CSA & CCM models. Moves on to examining existing security tools - native to the cloud provider, legcy vendors and content security etc.  The overview of building a security strategy seems very useful. Containerised microservices security attack diagrm seems informative when coupled with the deployment best practices notes.

Chapter 3 - Looking at regulatory compliance in the cloud 
The chapter covers essentially the same regulatory acts from GDPR through HIPAA as the CEH course covered, so is a useful reminder. The chapter is rounded out by looking at continuous automated monitoring of compliance to avoid playing compliance catch up.

Chapter 4 - Building an organisational culture around security
The constituents of a good cyber security team are analysed, before moving on to look at cloud maturity levels vs automation level, and how to embed security into the engineers workflow via CI/CD.

Chapter 5 - Forecasting changes in cloud security
Consideres that cloud security will continue to eveolve and looks at how to blueprint risk management - identify, protect, detect, respond, and then recover.

Chapter 6 - Ten cloud security recommendations
Take a cloudcentric approach - leave behind dated on-prem pratices.
Embrace the shared security model - cloud providers are typically better at security than on-prem.
Use a zero trust strategy - never trust, always verify. Segregate cloud into zones.
Engage with business groups, devops, and governance early.
Know your exposure - monitor usage and config, use MFA, and lock down management interfaces.
Understand the attacker - increasingly attacks are automated.
Evluare your security and complince options.
Empower yourself with knowledge - knowledge is power, or at least risk mitigation.
Believe in prevention.
Secure IaaS and PaaS.
Use automation to eliminate bottlenecks.

## What was good about the book?
Its a short quick read that gives a very expansive high level view of the most important topics for further study for those responsible for cloud secuirty in their organisations. The building a security strategy section was helpful.

## What could be improved, clarified, or covered in more depth?
Theres an obvious lack of depth to the topic covered due to te very compressed size of the book - its clearly aimed t pique interest rather than educate to actioanble depth.

## What did I learn from reading it?
I didn't learn a lot from this one, but it was a good refresher of topics covered on my CEH course.

## Would I recommend the book to other people at my stage of the InfoSec journey?
Yes, but also to anyone in a CxO role who needs to improve their cloud security knowledge, so most of the C-suite other than the CIO/CTO/CISO roles.
