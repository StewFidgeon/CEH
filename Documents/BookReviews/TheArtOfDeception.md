## What specifically does the book cover?
Preface - the book starts out by giving a few details of Mitnicks childhood, and how by the age of 12 he had learned enough social engineering and hacker thinking to travel for free throughout the LA / San Fernando Valley area by using dicarded blank transfers from the bus station bin, and purchasing a special hole punch used by conductors to tell the next bus driver where the trasnfer ticket was for. Mitnick then talks about his introduction to and love of Phreaking, and briefly discusses his time as a private investigator mastering the art of Social Engineering.


Introduction - The introduction just talks through very briefly the five main areas of organisation of the book which are:- securities weakest link, looking at how social engineers misuse your trust, how social engineers gain physical access to your site, finally how to reduce or prevent social engineering attacks in your business, and finally a security at a galnce style summary.

Chapter 1 Securities Weakest Link introduces the idea of obtaining sensitive information or passwords simply by pretending to be someone else and just asking for it. The chapter presents a view that security is an illusion but in so far as it is real, it's a process and not a product. Mitnick presents a brief history of Stanley Rifkin's social engineering over at Security Pacific which turned out to be one of the largest bank heists in history, netting USD 10,200,000 back in 1978.
