## What's the book about?
The book is about the human element of secuirty - specifically social engineering and how to design systems, processes, and training to reduce the risk to your enterprise.


## What specifically does the book cover?
Preface - the book starts out by giving a few details of Mitnicks childhood, and how by the age of 12 he had learned enough social engineering and hacker thinking to travel for free throughout the LA / San Fernando Valley area by using dicarded blank transfers from the bus station bin, and purchasing a special hole punch used by conductors to tell the next bus driver where the trasnfer ticket was for. Mitnick then talks about his introduction to and love of Phreaking, and briefly discusses his time as a private investigator mastering the art of Social Engineering.

Introduction - The introduction just talks through very briefly the five main areas of organisation of the book which are:- securities weakest link, looking at how social engineers misuse your trust, how social engineers gain physical access to your site, finally how to reduce or prevent social engineering attacks in your business, and finally a security at a galnce style summary.

Chapter 1 Securities Weakest Link introduces the idea of obtaining sensitive information or passwords simply by pretending to be someone else and just asking for it. The chapter presents a view that security is an illusion but in so far as it is real, it's a process and not a product. Mitnick presents a brief history of Stanley Rifkin's social engineering over at Security Pacific which turned out to be one of the largest bank heists in history, netting USD 10,200,000 back in 1978. The chapter closes by discussing corporate innocence, terrorism & deception, and whats coming up in the book with an interesting aside that Mitnick views parents are being the greatest of all social engineers.

Chapter 2 When Innocuous Information Isn't. The chapter begins by describing an simple three call attack where the first call obtains the name of a piece of information required for the hack, the second call posing as a representative of the target company obtains the value for that information and the next number to call, and the third call is to the actual target of information exfiltration using the information previously gathered. The point is that individual pieces of seemingly innocuous information gathered over time and distance can be brought together to achieve something else of far greater significance. The 'con' as Mitnick describes it is then disassembled and analysed in detail, which is mostly using pretence - on one call he pretned to be an author, then on the next call to a different individual at the same institution he pretneds to be from the mark conducting a survey, and in the third call he's pretending to be a customer - never the same story twice and always with different people to reduce suspicion. Once you have the info you need you should ask further trivial questions as if challenged they're only likely to remember the last few questions asked.

The second sample con in the chapter deals with giving the mark what sounds like insider information to allay their fears but isn't as part of asking for a phone number. Asking, for example, which office the mark works in Lake View or Mountain View, which is just information you've grabbed from the company website or corporate returns. The 2nd call uses the first piece of information (the phone number she obtained), ro obtain the format of cost codes and an actual cost code for HQ. 3rd call goes to an irrelevant department but asks whoever answers for the next phone number she needs. And the final call goes to the publications department (last bit of info required) to order a printed phonebook which contains the names, roles, and corporate structure for everyone in the company.  Internal phonebooks used to be considered low value, but they're great for headhunters, hackers posing as other people etc.

I wonder how well the techniques in this chapter have aged in the pandemic when everyone uses video calling linked to an internal Teams account or similar?

Chapter 3 The Direct Attack: Just Asking For It. The chapter suggests that directly asking for a piece of information after you've familiarised yourself with organisational jargon and department structures may sound legitimate enough that someone will assume you're an insider and just cooperate and provide information. 

I'm still left wondering how easy it is to pretend to be an insider now.  I can easily tell if the call originates within my company on Teams or if its external, so just telling me you're in the VP's office won't work.

Chapter 4 Building Trust. A good social engineer would expect to be met with suspicion and resistance, so would plan their atack ahead of time by anticipating the sort of questions his target might ask, in order to make the answers sound routine and boring.   If you know the same person will answer the phone whenver you call it, then you can make repeated calls for fake advice or help requests over a longer period of time to establish rapport, before engaging in the actual con.

The chapter continues the idea of using one call to a node (store, branch, or franchize) to gain an instant higher level of trust with a second node in a second call by impersonating the first node. Don't trust fellow employees too much - they may not be who they say they are and they may not be doing what they say they're doing.

Learn the targets terminology. Terminology gives credibility and credibility builds trust.

I can see how this might work with smaller businesses where they may not have a corporate network with video calling, but for anything large like S&P 500 companies I'm really unsure this would still work.  Obviously it would if you can first enter the building or trojan your way onto a corporate laptop.

Chapter 5 "Let Me Help You". The chapter starts out explaining how to cause a network problem for someone by getting them to give you their patch panel and port number, which you then use on a second call to the networking team posing as help desk and ask for their port to be turned off temporarily. The mark then calls you to have it fixed, so you call the real team back to have the port enabled.   When calling the mark back as call 4 you then also have them download some uptodate diagnostic software, which is obviously just a hidde backdoor to their machine.
