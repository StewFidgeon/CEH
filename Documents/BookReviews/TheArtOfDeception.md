## What specifically does the book cover?
Preface - the book starts out by giving a few details of Mitnicks childhood, and how by the age of 12 he had learned enough social engineering and hacker thinking to travel for free throughout the LA / San Fernando Valley area by using dicarded blank transfers from the bus station bin, and purchasing a special hole punch used by conductors to tell the next bus driver where the trasnfer ticket was for. Mitnick then talks about his introduction to and love of Phreaking, and briefly discusses his time as a private investigator mastering the art of Social Engineering.

Introduction - The introduction just talks through very briefly the five main areas of organisation of the book which are:- securities weakest link, looking at how social engineers misuse your trust, how social engineers gain physical access to your site, finally how to reduce or prevent social engineering attacks in your business, and finally a security at a galnce style summary.

Chapter 1 Securities Weakest Link introduces the idea of obtaining sensitive information or passwords simply by pretending to be someone else and just asking for it. The chapter presents a view that security is an illusion but in so far as it is real, it's a process and not a product. Mitnick presents a brief history of Stanley Rifkin's social engineering over at Security Pacific which turned out to be one of the largest bank heists in history, netting USD 10,200,000 back in 1978. The chapter closes by discussing corporate innocence, terrorism & deception, and whats coming up in the book with an interesting aside that Mitnick views parents are being the greatest of all social engineers.

Chapter 2 When Innocuous Information Isn't. The chapter begins by describing an simple three call attack where the first call obtains the name of a piece of information required for the hack, the second call posing as a representative of the target company obtains the value for that information and the next number to call, and the third call is to the actual target of information exfiltration using the information previously gathered. The point is that individual pieces of seemingly innocuous information gathered over time and distance can be brought together to achieve something else of far greater significance. The 'con' as Mitnick describes it is then disassembled and analysed in detail, which is mostly using pretence - on one call he pretned to be an author, then on the next call to a different individual at the same institution he pretneds to be from the mark conducting a sruvey, and in the third call he's pretending to be a customer - never the same story twice and always with different people to reduce suspicion.
