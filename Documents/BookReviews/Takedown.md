## What's the book about?
The book essentially describes Kevin Mitnicks break in to a bunch of Shimomuras computers, and his journey to track down and have law enforcement arrest Mitnick for the crime.

Obviously given the subject matter and the fact that the book was published in 1996, everything is a little dated.  However, the book provides a great outline of the battle between two recognised experts in their field, and the techniques and counter techniques used.

Of interest, and something not covered on the CEH given its red team nature, was an insight into the emotional and psychological effect of being a victim of malicious hacking and the invasion of provacy that follows.

Chapter 10 includes an interesting point about time.  That absent having synchronised clocks on the afected coiputers or the ability to tell the time gap between their state, reconstruction of events from disparate and distributed logs can be difficult.

Chapter 12 gives details of an alleged discussion between Mitnick and another hacker known in the book as "jsz".  I thought this was interesting in terms of how hackers communicate with each other and how exploits are or were shared, and the different levels of expertise in one operating system or another were traded to achieve various outcomes though essentially malicious teamwork.


## What was good about the book?
I particularly found useful the description of Mitnicks attack, and progression through the attached computer systems, including the variety of techniques used and or attempted.


## What could be improved, clarified, or covered in more depth?
Chapter 9 gives some very brief details of log analysis to interpret what the hacker was doing rooting through MArkoffs email.  If there's ever a revised edition of th ebook, providing greater detail of how this analysis was completed would be very valuable.

Chapter 10 provides very basic details of a backdoor into a system designed to give up root access.   Greater detail here may have distracted from the story, but would have provided an interesting view of backdoor construction.


## What did I learn from reading it?
The book provides an interesting overview into how hackers communicate, trade, and work together, as well as a roadmap through a hack that reasonably well correlates with those discussed on the CEH course.

## Would I recommend the book to other people at my stage of the InfoSec journey?
Yes, I'd definitely recommend reading the book, though as with all stories told by a "victor", its useful to keep in mind there's always two sides to every coin and Mitnick may well have a very different view on the activities and events described.
