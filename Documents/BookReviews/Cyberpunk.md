## What's the book about?
The book is essentially a narrative investigation into the 80s hacking scene in North America and Europe.  While the book is very dated, the influence the individuals covered would go on to have on the cyber security inudstry was industry defining and paved the way for much of what has followed.

## What specifically does the book cover?
Part 1 - Kevin Mitnick
This section details Kevin Mitick's exploits with Lewis de Payne and Susan Thunder, and the part they may or may not have played in his eventual capture by authorities in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Part 2 - Pengo & Hagbard
This section details the early days of some of the founders of the Chaos Computer Club, alleged links to the KGB, and an insight into a heavily divided East & West Berlin.

Part 3 - RTM 
Robert Tappan Morris, of Morris worm fame. While Morris would go on to distance himself from his most famous creation, the impact the worm had upon the cyber security field has been enduring and significant.  

## What was good about the book?
Its really accessible and as someone who first strayed into the world of computer security back in the very early 90s, when the "Free Kevin" campaign was still at its height, its a h=fascinating look into what at the time was still a relatively inaccessible world.

## What could be improved, clarified, or covered in more depth?
An updated book closing out the life storys of the main protagonists, who are sadly now mostly deceased, would make for a riveting update to the book.

## What did I learn from reading it?
One of the weakest links in black hat hackers ways of operating continue to be the people around them that they trust.

## Would I recommend the book to other people at my stage of the InfoSec journey?
Probably not as most people at the beginning like me are much younger and may not even know who any fo these people actually were. They should, but so often those that invent an industry are quickly forgotten by those who follow in their footsteps.
