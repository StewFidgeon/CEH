## What's the book about?
The book follows Cliff's initial attempts to track down an accounting discrepancy in computer usage at Berkley Uni.  During the course of this activity, Cliff uncovers a hacker in his computer and sets about trying to track them down.

The incident, which is based on a real life situation, takes place long before modern computer security (1986), interest from large government agencies in computer misuse, and at a time when options for tracing a hacker were few.   

Cliff is a trained astronomer, not a sysadmin, and his growth during the course of events to become at the time a leading expert on computer security was interesting and impressive.

Many modern techniques either didn't exist at the time or were not well known, such as Cliffs successful use of a honeypot to attract and observe the hacker going through his systems.   His discovery that the hacker wasn't only breaking into their system, but using it as a launch pad to attack mostly military computers, may seem like standard operating procedure now, but at the time would have been a disturbing discovery.

## What was good about the book?
The book is very accessible and portrays Cliffs original ignorance of cybercrime extremely well, alongside his journey to achieving something many InfoSec professionals in large corporations never do - the successful prosecution of a hacker following an international operation.

## What could be improved, clarified, or covered in more depth?
The book, while a very entertaining read, is rather more lengthy than it needs to be from a pure InfoSec perspective.   I'd recommend reading the pre-cursor paper Mr Stoll wrote called "Stalking the wily hacker", which is considerably more concise.

Stoll, C., 1988. Stalking the wily hacker. Communications of the ACM, 31(5), pp.484-497.

## What did I learn from reading it?
The hacker didn't create any new exploits or zero days - he simply applied already known exploits to a wider range of targets, compromising about 30 out of 450 computers he attacked.

Cliffs difficulty in knowing who to call, getting through to the right person at whichever agency he was dealing with, and trying to help coordinate them echo's the problems Shimomura was having at the time with his pursuit of Mitnick in the book Takedown.

Organisations can still learn from this book about the need to have a thoroughly thought out security policy with a detailed plan in place for handling breaches and a well-known coordinator to execute the plan.

## Would I recommend the book to other people at my stage of the InfoSec journey?
Yes, great read for beginners.
