# CEH

This repository is just where I put stuff that I need to do to keep my CEH cert current.   You probably just want to ignore this - its only public so they can find it for renewal credits.

I intend to divide this between documentation such as book reviews, presentations etc, and code where I've produced tools for continuing education credits.
